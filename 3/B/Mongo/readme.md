The MongoDB collections for this task are very large in size(over 7GB) and take a lot of time to get created. Thus, due to the time restraint, only partial data has been uploaded on this repo. When run for a longer period of time, the code will successfully create the entire collections. Also, the code is an initial model and can be improved to function more effectively. 

For the compelete dataset, please raise an issue.
